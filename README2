BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY ISSUES FOR HEYU VERSION 2

Configuration file
------------------
Heyu version 2 can use an existing Heyu configuration file
from version 1 (~/.x10config or /etc/x10.conf) provided
it is renamed and moved to the new location where Heyu 
version 2 expects to find it - either "~/.heyu/x10config"
or "/etc/heyu/x10.conf" (notice the 'dot' changes).
There are a number of new configuration options for
version 2 that the user may then want to add, which are
explained in both the x10config.5 man page and in the
example file "x10config.sample" provided.  Of course
for some users it may be more convenient to simply rename
and modify the "x10config.sample" file.

In operation, Heyu version 2 must write some files in
the same directory as the configuration file, so this
directory must be writeable.

Schedule file
-------------
In most cases an existing schedule file used for Heyu 
version 1 will work in version 2, however dawn/dusk
related events are now handled directly by the Heyu
program and the old 'makesched' utility is no longer
used.  The default name for the schedule file is now
x10.sched and Heyu version 2 will expect to find it
in the same directory as the configuration file.
(Its name can be changed via the configuration file.)

Under Heyu version 2, the CM11A clock is maintained
on Local Standard Time throughout the year.  Events
in the schedule file are assumed to be Local Civil
Time (i.e., Wall Clock Time) and Heyu automatically 
adjusts them during periods of Daylight Saving Time.  
Heyu version 2 automatically sets the CM11A clock
to the correct time (derived from the system clock)
when a schedule is uploaded or when the 'heyu setclock'
command is executed.


Warning
-------
Users running a dual-boot system with MS-Windows
should read the warning in the x10config.5 man page
about running X10's ActiveHome software while booted
into Windows if the CM11A has been programmed under 
Unix/Linux by Heyu with certain configuration options.
