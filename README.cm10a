Note for CM10A (IBM HD16) owners:

For Heyu to support the CM10A, you must append
the keyword CM10A to the TTY directive in your
Heyu configuration file, e.g.,
  TTY  /dev/ttyS0  CM10A

For this change to become fully effective it must
be incorporated in the heyu_relay process running in
the background.  If the heyu_relay is currently running
(almost any Heyu command will have started it running),
this requires stopping and restarting Heyu, e.g.,
  heyu stop
  heyu cm10a_init
